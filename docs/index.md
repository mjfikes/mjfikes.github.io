## About me

My name is Matthew Fikes. Welcome to my data science portfolio.

I am a graduate student in a data science program at Bellevue University and the Coordinator of Research and Analysis
at Mohawk Valley Community College. Much of my work involves using education data for assessment and predictive modeling.

I am passionate for data and work to leverage the tools of a data scientist to improve academic outcomes for my students.
Aside from common tools like Python and R I work with Higher Education specific data solutions from Ellucian like Banner and Argos.

My undergraduate work focused on Studio Art, but I work with both traditional and digital media. 
This creative visual work has fostered an understanding in communicating through visual design which fed into effective data visualization.

### Python Coding Examples


| Project                               | Description |
|---------------------------------------|-------------|
| [Cash Register](https://github.com/mjfikes/DSCPortfolio/tree/main/Cash%20Register)|This is an example cash register program. It supports adding and removing items from a cart and updating prices. Additional features offer price adjustment, sales, and tax changes. These require input of a user ID and are saved to a management log.|
| [Aircraft Registry Scraper](https://github.com/mjfikes/DSCPortfolio/tree/main/Canadian%20Air%20Registry)|This script will automatically grab files from the Canadian Civil Aircraft Registry. These are updated by the CCA regularly to the same location and this joins the files together and exports the results to an Excel document.|
| [PythonWeather](https://github.com/mjfikes/DSCPortfolio/tree/main/PythonWeather)|This is a fully-functional weather program that will return the 5-day forecast for a location based on City/State/Country or Zipcode. <p>This program leverages APIs for the weather (OpenWeatherAPI) and Zipcode lookup.|

### Analysis Examples
#### Education Analyses

| Project                               | Description |
|---------------------------------------|-------------|
| [Dual Enrollment Pathways](https://github.com/mjfikes/DSCPortfolio/tree/main/Dual%20Enrollment%20Pathways)|This project has two tasks - predicting high school to college enrollment with decision trees and random forests and then clustering them to look for similarities.|
| College Retention Prediction          |             |
| Instructor Salary and Student Success |             |
| [Poverty and Education](https://github.com/mjfikes/DSCPortfolio/tree/main/Poverty%20and%20Education)|This study looks at the connections between childhood poverty and academic achievement. Analyzing 3 datasets I attempt to find a correlation between indicators for childhood poverty and academic success measured by high school graduation|
| [Gateway Courses and Academic Success](https://github.com/mjfikes/DSCPortfolio/tree/main/Gateway%20Courses%20and%20Academic%20Success)|This project explores the impact of high-enrollment high failure gateway college courses on semester to semester retention in a community college setting.|

#### Miscellaneous Analyses

| Project                               | Description |
|---------------------------------------|-------------|
| [Grocery Store Comparison](https://github.com/mjfikes/DSCPortfolio/tree/main/Grocery%20Store%20Competition%20Study)|This project looks at two theories about location choice of two competing grocerty stores - Wegmans and Price Chopper. The first theory looks at the income level of areas the stores serve and the second looks to cluster the stores geographically to see if there are any clearly defined borders.|
