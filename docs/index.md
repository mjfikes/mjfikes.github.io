## About me

My name is Matthew Fikes. Welcome to my data science portfolio.

I am a graduate student in a data science program at Bellevue University and the Coordinator of Research and Analysis
at Mohawk Valley Community College. Much of my work involves working with education data for assessment and predictive modeling.

My undergraduate work focused on Studio Art, but I work with both traditional and digital media.

Additional features offer price adjustment, sales, and tax changes. These require input of a user ID and are saved to a management log. | ![Cash Register](/assets/pictures/cash_title.png)|
| [Canadian Registry](https://github.com/mjfikes/DSCPortfolio/tree/main/Canadian%20Air%20Registry) | This script will automatically grab files from the Canadian Civil Aircraft Registry. These are updated by the CCA regularly to the same location and this joins the files together and exports the results to an Excel document. |-- |
