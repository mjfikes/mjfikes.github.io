## About me

My name is Matthew Fikes. Welcome to my data science portfolio.

I am a graduate student in a data science program at Bellevue University and the Coordinator of Research and Analysis
at Mohawk Valley Community College. Much of my work involves working with education data for assessment and predictive modeling.

My undergraduate work focused on Studio Art, but I work with both traditional and digital media.
