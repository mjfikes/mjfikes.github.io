## About me

My name is Matthew Fikes. Welcome to my data science portfolio.

I am a graduate student in a data science program at Bellevue University and the Coordinator of Research and Analysis
at Mohawk Valley Community College. Much of my work involves using education data for assessment and predictive modeling.

I am passionate for data and work to leverage the tools of a data scientist to improve academic outcomes for my students.
Aside from common tools like Python and R I work with Higher Education specific data solutions from Ellucian like Banner and Argos.

My undergraduate work focused on Studio Art, but I work with both traditional and digital media. 
This creative visual work has fostered an understanding in communicating through visual design which fed into effective data visualization.

These are updated by the CCA regularly to the same location and this joins the files together and exports the results to an Excel document.|
| [PythonWeather](https://github.com/mjfikes/DSCPortfolio/tree/main/PythonWeather)|This is a fully-functional weather program that will return the 5-day forecast for a location based on City/State/Country or Zipcode. <p>This program leverages APIs for the weather (OpenWeatherAPI) and Zipcode lookup.|
